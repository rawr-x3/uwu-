uwu! is a discord bot that will eventually pack moderation tools for your server and for anything osu related! Like tracking top plays, or even more!

Currently, the bot only can !kick and !ban people with permissions and also do random thingys

To stay in the know of the bot and to be the first to see and experience new features, you can invite your bot to your own server! with this link below

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=714249440109527071&permissions=0&scope=bot

This bot was created using JavaScript, there are no requirements for your PC specifically, just get a discord server, invite it, and your done!

There also is no LICENSE needed, just use my stuff i dont really care


More features will be added soon
If you have any questions, feel free to PM me on Discord.
